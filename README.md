# Light Touch Vim Colour Scheme

Does your current theme look like a clown blew their confetti all over your monitor?\
Created by someone who learnt about colour theory and then ignored it all?\
Mr. Pike once told you colours are childish so you raw-dogged Vi with no theme?\
So dark it wouldn't look out of place in a CGI scene from a ~~Netflix~~ budget sci-fi series?

Aims are:
  - optimised for reading
  - code to stand out from comments
  - minimal but helpful use of muted colours

Yes, some people do like light themes in $current_year.
